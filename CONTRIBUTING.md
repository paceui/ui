## How to Add a New Component 💡

Adding a new animated component is the best way to contribute. Follow these four steps to ensure your component is integrated correctly.

### 1. Create the Component

First, create your component file and place it in the following directory:

- `src/components/gsap/`

We use **GSAP** for all animations, so make sure your component leverages its power for smooth interactions.

### 2. Add Component Demos

Showcase your component! A default demo is required, but feel free to add more to show off different variations.

- Add the default demo here: `src/demo/components/{your-component-name}/default.tsx`
- Add any additional demos in the same folder: `src/demo/components/{your-component-name}/`

### 3. Write the Documentation

Documentation helps others use your component. We use **Fumadocs** for our documentation site.

- Create an MDX file for your component: `/src/content/docs/components/{your-component-name}.mdx`
- To make it appear in the sidebar, add the filename to `/src/content/docs/components/meta.json`.

    ```json
    // src/content/docs/components/meta.json
    {
        "pages": [
            "...",
            "your-component-name" // <-- Add your component's filename here
        ]
    }
    ```

### 4. Register the Component

The final step is to register your component so it can be used throughout the library.

- Open the registry file: `src/lib/registry/gsap-component.ts`
- Add an entry for your new component. You can copy an existing entry and modify it. This step is straightforward—just follow the existing format!

## Submitting a Pull Request

Once your component is ready, push your branch to your fork and open a pull request.

1.  **Push your branch**:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
2.  **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the PaceUI repository on GitHub and click "New pull request".
